This is the phoned distribution, version 0.1.
phoned is distributed under the license outlined in COPYRIGHT. Please read
it before use!

This is now a hybrid of the older cidserv distribution. I might go to CVS
some day.

To build, simply type 'make'. phoned was written for BSD make (just "make"
on regular BSD systems, "pmake" on many linux machines.) For further
installation instructions, please see doc/install_guide.txt.

NOTE that lib/libpvf/ (library for converting from rockwell and other
formats to pvf, a portable format) is GPL'd code. However, I don't forsee
many troubles, since the BSD license is compatible.

You will find the following directories in this source archive:

cnd/ - Caller ID program
doc/ - misc. documentation
examples/ - example scripts
include/ - global include files
lib/ - API libraries
phonectl/ - command line client to phoned
phoned/ - main phone daemon written in C
scripts/ - various administration and cool scripts
xfone/ - Tcl/Tk interface to phoned

The scripts need tcllib. Please modify the paths in the scripts to libraries
so that they work.
