This is the phoned distribution, version 1.0.
phoned is distributed under the license outlined in COPYRIGHT. Please read
it before use!

This is now a hybrid of the older cidserv distribution.

For building, Tcl 8.4 is *required*. You should have it, since it's so good.
Other stuff needs Tk 8.4 as well.

To build, simply type 'make'. phoned was written for BSD make (just "make"
on regular BSD systems, "pmake" on many linux machines.) For further
installation instructions, please see doc/install_guide.txt, which may be
out of date.

NOTE that lib/libpvf/ (library for converting from rockwell and other
formats to pvf, a portable format) is GPL'd code. However, I don't forsee
many troubles, since the BSD license is compatible. Also, the MD5 code is
(C) L. Peter Deutsch (of Aladdin), and is under a BSD-like license. Please
respect it.

You will find the following directories in this source archive:

cidclient/ - Win32 caller ID notifier, for VB6 (with NSIS script), like xcid
doc/ - misc. documentation
examples/ - example scripts (nothing yet)
include/ - global include files
lib/ - API libraries
	libpvf/ - libpvf for converting native modem formats to pvf
	tcl/ - various Tcl libraries, such as my udom AF_LOCAL channel module
phonectl/ - command line client to phoned. Very spartan; use at own risk.
phoned/ - main phone daemon written in C
	modems/ - modem drivers
scripts/ - various administration and cool scripts
xfone/ - Tcl/Tk interface to phoned
xcid/ - CID notifier for X clients. Not built by default; cd xcid && cat README

The scripts need tcllib. Please modify the paths in the scripts to libraries
so that they work.

xfone needs tablelist. Please modify configure.tcl and xfone/xfone.tcl to
point to your wish interpreter.
