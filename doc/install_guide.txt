1.0 Introduction
phoned is [supposed to be] a powerful phone answering system, much like
VOCP. However, it is more client-server based.

The phoned distribution consists of the following:
*phoned - the main daemon responsible for logging stuff and talking to
 clients and the modem
*xfone - a Tcl/Tk application for checking messages and administering
 mailboxes
*Various scripts to administer stuff
*phonectl to talk to phoned via command line

2.0 Requirements
In order to use the base phoned, you must have at least the
following:
*A Unix system capable of using sockets and talking to a modem
	(tested on FreeBSD) (the phoned suite will NOT run on windows. Get a
				better OS. It might run on OSX.)
*Tcl 8.4 (for xfone and scripts)
*Tk 8.4 (for xfone)
*Tcllib with md5 stuff.
*A C compiler (capable of understanding my mix of ANSI C and other dialect)...GCC works well.
*PCRE
*SQLite3 libraries (with Tcl bindings for scripts)
*A voice modem supported by us. Tested with the Diamond SupraExpress 56i
 Sp (Rockwell chipset/driver)
*Telephone service (no shit?)
*A telephone, mic, or other recording device to record the greeting messages
*A friend who has a telephone to annoy so he can test the system ;-)

Optional:
*Caller ID service from your phone company in order to use any filter and notify stuff
 (this is basically a requirement, but not so much as to make stuff not work)
*The Festival Speech Synthesis package, available under FreeBSD ports as
 audio/festival/, in order to use the speech capabilities (highly
 recommended.) (this is not implemented yet -Dan)

2.1 Compilation and Installation
Compilation is fairly straightforward: cd to the root directory of the distribution and
type "make". There is currently no install target, but installation is very simple: copy
the phoned binary and configuration file to appropriate places. (/usr/local/{bin,etc} work
well).
