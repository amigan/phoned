TODO
For phoned:
*Handle conditions (write the glue) - Halfway done.
*Parse socket in - ok, add more commands
*Make modem and other stuff pluggable - modularised it, now for actual plugin code
*Write rockwell voice support - libpvf is here
*Write answering subsystem
*Add DB management functions as remote commands
*Fix all possible memory leaks (isn't this always a TODO?)
*Add support for actual INET sockets (shouldn't be too hard)
For phonectl:
*Clean up interface
*Add ncurses mode
For xfone:
*Improve it, specifically:
*Clean up event stuff. I.E. add a command that waits for and returns what the server gives us.
*INET sockets. See above.
For scripts:
*Clean up usermaint.tcl, add more stuff

For everything:
*Write documentation

OUTSTANDING BUGS:
*Certain race conditions (i.e. closing a socket during a blocking I/O call inside sendwr()) will leave mutexes open and the user logged in (or the servicing thread running entirely).
	This needs to be fixed, either by detecting the system call interrupt or other means. Hopefully the IO call will exit in time, but we cannot hope for all things. 
	Fix this for good.
*uu_unlock() doesn't seem to be removing the modem lock file. Why?
