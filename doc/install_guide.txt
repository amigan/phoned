1.0 Introduction
phoned is [supposed to be] a powerful phone answering system, much like
VOCP. However, it is more-client-server based.

The phoned distribution consists of the following:
*phoned - the main daemon responsible for logging stuff and talking to
 clients and the modem
*xfone - a Tcl/Tk application for checking messages and administering
 mailboxes

2.0 Requirements
In order to use the base phoned and phonecall, you must have at least the
following:
*A Unix system capable of using sockets and talking to a modem
	(tested on FreeBSD) (the phoned suite will NOT run on windows. Get a
				better OS. It might run on OSX.)
*Perl (tested on 5.8.6) (dunno why, just have it)
*A voice modem supported by us. Tested with the Diamond SupraExpress 56i
 Sp (Rockwell chipset/driver)
*Telephone service
*A telephone, mic, or other recording device to record the greeting messages
*A friend who has a telephone to annoy so he can test the system ;-)

Optional:
*Caller ID service from your phone company in order to use cnd
*The Festival Speech Synthesis package, available under FreeBSD ports as
 audio/festival/, in order to use the speech capabilities (highly
 recommended.)

In order to run xfone, you need:
*Tcl 8.4
*Tk 8.4
