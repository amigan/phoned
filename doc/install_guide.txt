1.0 Introduction
phoned is [supposed to be] a powerful phone answering system, much like
VOCP. However, it is more-client-server based.
Its power stems from the use of vgetty, part of the mgetty+sendfax
distribution. It is available at:
	http://alpha.greenie.net/mgetty/
mgetty+sendfax is also available under FreeBSD ports as comms/mgetty+sendfax/.
I will not cover the installation and configuration of mgetty/vgetty here.
There are many good docs on the process.

The phoned distribution consists of the following:
*phoned - the main daemon responsible for logging stuff and talking to
 clients
*phonecall - a Perl script called by vgetty when it answers the phone,
 responsible for talking to phoned and telling vgetty what to do (play sound
 files, interpret menu options, etc)
*xfone - a Tcl/Tk application for checking messages and administering
 mailboxes
*cnd - called by vgetty when the phone rings to tell phoned to log the call,
 alert network users and either reject or accept the call based on the
 caller. (based on a tiny bit of code from my old cidserv application, it is
 compatible with its clients.)

2.0 Requirements
In order to use the base phoned and phonecall, you must have at least the
following:
*A Unix system capable of running perl, vgetty, and using sockets 
	(tested on FreeBSD) (the phoned suite will NOT run on windows. Get a
				better OS. It might run on OSX.)
*Perl (tested on 5.8.6)
*The Modem::Vgetty Perl module, available from CPAN
*A properly installed and configured vgetty
*A voice modem supported by vgetty. Tested with the Diamond SupraExpress 56i
 Sp (Rockwell chipset/driver)
*Telephone service
*A telephone, mic, or other recording device to record the greeting messages
*A friend who has a telephone to annoy so he can test the system ;-)

Optional:
*Caller ID service from your phone company in order to use cnd
*The Festival Speech Synthesis package, available under FreeBSD ports as
 audio/festival/, in order to use the speech capabilities (highly
 recommended.)

In order to run xfone, you need:
*Tcl 8.4
*Tk 8.4
